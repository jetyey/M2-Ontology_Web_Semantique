This grill is so great I\u2019m becoming a griller! I wish I had bought the larger one now. The materials are so good for grilling - it conducts heat really well. The drawer for coal is a game changer. I still line it with tin foil so that\u2019s an easy clean up but having it in the drawer makes it even better. Highly recommend this grill."

Trying to remove the current corner bench screw has also resulted in the wood on the bench itself being chipped. This has been the worst assembly of my life & I'm very disappointed in the manufacturer and I could not afford to pay the extra money to have someone come and assemble the product for me. This was advertised as something I should have been able to put together At this point, I'm going to have to cut away a piece of seat just to be able to close the storage bench so I can use the product. I will say that my experience using Overstock itself has been pleasant but I'm not sure I can even get a refund for this product because it wont come apart to able to be sent back. Again, this is the manufacturer's fault and I just want people to be aware when purchasing this product that you will need to check all of the holes and probably drill them yourself BEFORE attempting to screw the parts together.

The carpet was dry to the touch in 90 minutes with a ceiling fan running..\nThe water tank needed filling quite a few times, and the dirty water dumped an equal number of times (what it took out of the carpet, that gets vacuumed weekly with a Dyson Animal, was extreme). After all that, there is still detergent in that reservoir ready for use.\nYes, the cord is on the short side. This is not a reason to hesitate purchasing this machine. I understand the reasoning for the short cord, encouraging you not too get too far ahead of yourself, and then having to walk across the entire carpet while wet to unplug the cord. I can cope with the shorter cord.\nI've used a Hoover, older machine in the past and was not impressed. I am completely impressed with this model. It does everything it promises.\nHINT: After turning it off to fill the water tank, and dumping the dirty water, make sure you set them back in securely. To re-establish suction, even if you are in the rinse mode, go back to the WASH mode for at least one swipe, then go back to the RINSE mode and you'll have great suction again."

Seriously, it only took about an hour to fully dry my carpets after cleaning them. \n\nI am embarrassed to say that I was subsequently seduced by the fancy brands out there that claim to do so much more and use this claim to justify the much higher cost. \n\nLong story not as long, I am back with my wonderful Hoover and will likely keep it as long as I have carpets to clean.

I had a older model machine that was very heavy and bulky, It was not user friendly. I researched for a month and found this machine, and it works like a charm, assembly was supppppppppppppper simple. It comes with great attachments. I cleaned my couch and the juice box stains came right out. Takes care of kool laid like a charm. If my dog has an accident it comes right up, no more scrubbing it up on my knees. The machine is super simple to maintain and clean. The compartments come off easily and go back on easily. Great investment and great value, especially if you have a busy family and high traffic areas in your home. "

I have a beach theme to my very small house. With little starfish and shell decorations here and there, I needed something to tie it all together and look like organized decor and a cozy room. The rug was they key factor. It brings it all together since it has the colors of most of the decor and I have many options for contrasting colors. I was pleasantly surprised after rolling it out that the corners laid FLAT! It still amazes me to think they went from being rolled up so tight to being flat on the floor. Before buying, I read reviews and tried to find out about vacuuming - difficult or not? Thankfully, it is no problem at all to vacuum with my 10 year old Hoover vacuum! I kept the rug pad from my previous area rug to use for this one and it is fine. Any kind of pad seems would work just fine. No complaints at all with this rug! Unfortunately, my dog (Shiba Inu) smelled something and ripped a quarter sized hole in the center towards the end. Luckily, the colors and lengths of the surrounding strands of rug make it unnoticeable. Risks of dog ownership! I took a picture with my camera on the floor and I also took one with a quarter standing up in the rug to show you the depth and also the density. The rug holds the quarter up on its side easily. If you are on the fence -go for it! I am so glad I did!! Enjoy! I am so happy with this purchase - and what a great price!"

After seeing these lamps online in a gorgeous foyer display, I bought the entire setting. I expected the more expensive console table and huge gold mirror to be nice, but I really wasn't sure about the crystal lamps. I've seen so many pieces that have air bubbles and pockets throughout, I hesitated. I'm SO happy I decided to take a chance and buy them. These lamps are absolutely stunning and perfect for re-creating the design setting I found. The soft light from the upscale shades reflect gently from the mirror behind and it creates a warm, romantic aura effect in my otherwise dim foyer. The crystal clear body is stunning and goes with any decor, yet it doesn't distract from the overall style statement. A very elegant look at an affordable price. I was able to re-created the professional design look from the photo beautifully and from only one store - Overstock! My foyer is glamorous and I love my lamps!

        "@value": "Overall, I give the breakfast nook 4 stars. I read other people reviews which convinced me to buy this table. This project takes will, time and patience. The color is light wood with gray not like the picture indicates but I love it since I dig rustic pieces. If you are overweight, this table is not for you. The table and bench are as thin as demonstrated. It is not heavy hard wood like the furniture stores carry. I use this nook to feed a family of 6. The single seat is interchangeable. It can go to the left or right. I love the fact that I can put the placemats in the seats. I set the table myself which took two days. Day One: Beyond frustrated. The screws wear out easily with a bit of force using a screwdriver and it really needs it because the wood is a bit tough and some sections do not have the pre-drilled holes. So I used the drill just to get a head start. I was careful but I do not recommend the drill. It even says it in the instructions. That night I wanted to cry because I felt that I had made an bad investment and left everything unfinished. Day Two: I was determined to take my sweet time and finish what I started. It took me 5 hours. Out of the bad screws, I had to replace 3 with some from the hardware store. Once I finished it, I love it even more because I worked on it. My honest advice: When turning the screws be firm and count, it took me 12-15 counts for the screw to firmly go in with moderate force and without damaging the screw. Don't be aggressive trying to finish fast, it will backfire! Also if you are tired or lacking patience that day, do not work on it. You need to be focused and have plenty of free time to get it done right. After all this, it was worth it. My kids love it, we can all sit and have a quality family dinner. Here's a pic: The dimensions were perfect for my square dining room."

        "@value": "Update: I\u2019m sad to say that my son and I get splinters because of the grain on table top and benches plus the benches separate from center section ALL the time. Not as happy as I was at first. We hardly use it. The set is beautiful and fits perfectly in my dining room. The color is true to picture, I bought the rustic faded looking set. What I love it that it is so easy to push the table inwards as well as the free standing bench and you have even more room! What sold me on this dining set is the corner shape to save space, how beautiful it looks and the storage under both benches. This is perfect for all of my son\u2019s colors/pencils, notebooks etc. I have zero storage space in my TH so this helps a lot. It is not deep enough for blankets and such but maybe a couch throw blanket or two in each and/or flat sheets for guests staying on the couch! CONS: 1. I have never ever had such a difficult time putting a piece of furniture together with an Allen Wrench. That is what you get and \u201cstar head Allen Wrench Screws\u201d, nothing else. The problem is the wrench is a smaller thing one which is fine but when trying to connect the benches and such together you can only get the screw in so far and then it is stuck, I mean STUCK!! I had my brother come over to help and he couldn\u2019t even get them in so when we were finally able to loosen them up enough to remove them I saw the hole they were getting screwed into were a fraction of the size of the screws, all sizes! It took hours and my brother couldn\u2019t feel his fingertips the next day so he went out and bought \u201cstar headed screws\u201d and a drill bit to match. Once we did that, it was easy. Just drug it out longer and had to purchase other supplies to put it together and I\u2019m glad we did, disappointed but no biggie. 2. The smoothness of the surfaces of the table tops and the benches. Do NOT try to whip off the table or bench with your bare hand or expect splinters!! I found out hard way brushing off crumbs last night. I wasn\u2019t expecting that and didn\u2019t see it in any of the reviews. It is only smooth one way not both ways, guess it\u2019s the \u201cgrain\u201d. I\u2019m working on how to fix that because you can put a super fine grit sand paper to it and immediately tell you did. I may call Customer Support to find out what I can do if I can\u2019t figure it out myself. Other than those 2 things, I LOVE it! Yes I would recommend this to anyone of my friends and family, I would just let them know it takes 2 ppl to assemble and might want to use your own screws, they don\u2019t even have to be \u201cStar headed\u201d just the SAME size! But don\u2019t let me discourage you, I love it!"

It arrived very quickly and is now my only vacuum cleaner having ditched both my upright and my canister vacuum since this Shark can do it all with the removable handheld unit.  I thought I was getting my carpets clean before, but I was only fooling myself and the proof is in the dust cup.  I like the  removable dust cup,  and snaps easily on and off. No more bags to replace.  The low speed setting on the floor attachment is perfect for my hardwood floors.  This is by far the best vacuum I have owned in twenty years and would recommend to anyone without reservation.  An excellent value."

I debated between the ivory and the grey but was won over by reviewers pictures of the ivory. It's definitely a darker ivory which reduced my worries about having a light colored rug with 2 young boys. The pile is quite high and my Shark still has a little trouble even on the high pile setting but we manage to get it clean. I love, love, love this rug and would HIGHLY recommend it. See attached pictures. The first one is right after I opened it (you can see what great shape it was in right out off the bat).

They arrived well packaged and it took  minimal assembly--very straight forward. The trickiest part is removing the protective cellophane sleeve off the shade.  Included were three other halogen bulbs for replacement into the lava lamp socket.... The sparkly lava lamp silver glitter is beautiful when you light it up and it starts dancing and throwing reflections up against the wall. The lamp has a three way switch, first the lava lamp pillar lights up; the second click turns off the lava lamp and illumines the big bulb under the shade. (not included: I use a high quality 100 watt  equivalent LED bulb)  and the third click light us the top and the bottom. Just really magical. The first day i just kept staring at the lights and how they transformed our bedroom... NOw I want to modernize the nightstands as well ...  I am quite happy with this purchase and so is my husband who is not particularly given to excitement about a lamp... he is delighted! I can recommend this."

        "@value": "I RECEIVED MY RING TODAY IN THE MAIL AND WAS SO VERY EXCITED TO GET IT SO FAST! WHEN MY WEDDING BAND WAS STOLEN IN A HOSPITAL X RAY DEPTARTMENT LOCKER ROOM, I WAS SO DEVASTATED. I SUBMITTED THE INFORMATION TO OUR HOME INSURANCE COMPANY EXPLAINING WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THEY SENT US A CHECK FOR ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THE ORIGIONAL WEDDING BAND HAD COST US. I DIDNT THINK THAT I WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO FIND A WEDDING BAND THAT LOOKED THE SAME AS MINE. IT WAS PURCHASED 9 YEARS AGO IN SAINT GEORGE UTAH. WE WENT TO A REPUTABLE JEWLER IN THE DETROIT MICHIGAN AREA AND ASKED TO LOOK AT THEIR WEDDING BANDS, SHOWING THEM ONE OF OUR WEDDING PICTURES OF OUR HANDS TOGETHER DISPLAYING OUR MATCHING WEDDING BANDS IN WHITE GOLD. WITH SMALL DIAMOND CHIPS ENCIRCLING AROUND BOTH OUTER AND INNER SIDES OF MY RING. MIKES RING HAD ONE LARGER CENTERED DIAMOND CHIP. WHEN WE LOOKED AT ALL OF THEIR BANDS, I DIDNT SEE ONE THAT EVEN RESEMBELED MINE. THE SALES WOMAN COULD SEE THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED. SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND SEE IF SHE COULD FIND A SIMILIAR AT LEAST WEDDING BAND. I GAVE HER ALL OF THE ORIGIONAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE JEWLER IN UTAH WITH THE KAROT OF GOLD IN THE BAND AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE 60 DIAMOND CHIPS AND THEIR COLOR , QUALITY ETC AND THAT COMBINED THE DIAMOND CHIPS ADDED UP TO A ONE KARAT DIAMOND. ALSO, THE NAME AND ADDRESS AND PHONE/FAX NUMBERS OF THE ORIGIONAL JEWLER IN SAINT GEORGE UTAH WAS ALSO GIVEN TO THIS SALES WOMAN. SHE SEEMED SO WILLING TO GO THE EXTRA MILE IN HELPING US. MIKE AND I DECIDED TO PURCHASE ONE OF THEIR BANDS JUST IN CASE SHE COULDNT FIND ANYTHING SIMILAR TO OUR STOLEN RING. SHE ASSURED US THAT WE COULD RETURN THIS PURCHASED BAND, WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED IF SHE FOUND A RING LIKE MINE. SO WE BOUGHT A BAND WITH DARK BUE SAPHIRES AND DIAMOND TINY STONES THAT WENT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CIRCLE OF THE RING ALTERNATING THE STONES, ONE DIAMOND THEN ONE BLUE SAPHIRE THEN ONE DIAMOND AND SO ON. I REALLY STARTED TO LIKE THIS NEW RING VERY MUCH. IT JUST TWINKLED SO BRIGHTLY IN THE SHOW CASE AND WHEN THE SALES GIRL PLACED IT ON MY LEFT HAND FINGER ..IT LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL AND JUST SPARKELED ..(MUCH MORE SO THAN MY ORIGIONAL BAND HAD WITH ONE CARAT OF DIAMOND CHIPS AROUND BOTH SIDES OF THE WHITE GOLD BAND.) I ASKED HER WHY MY OLD RING DIDNT GLISTEN LIKE THIS ONE DID. SHE SAID IT MOST LIKELY NEEDED TO BE CLEANED AND PUT THROUGH A SPECIAL PROCESS THAT RESTORES THE WHITE GOLD TO ITS ORIGIONAL SHINE AND THE DIAMONDS TO THEIRR ORIGIONAL SPARKLE. SHE TOLD ME THAT OFTEN SOAPS AND LOTIONS GET CAUGHT UNDERNEATH THE STONES PREVENTING THE LIGHT FROM PASSING THROUGHT THE STONES AND CAUSING THEM TO SPARKLE. SHE SAID IF SHE COULD LOCATE A RING LIKE MINE SHE WOULD SET UP A PLAN FOR US TO BRING THE RING IN EVERY SIX MONTHS TO BE CLEANED AND TO HAVE ALL THE DIAMONDS CHECKED AND PRONGS TIGHTENED AND ONCE A YEAR TO HAVE THE RING PUT THROUGH THIS PLATING AND CLEANING PROCESS FOR FREE. WE BOUGHT THE PLAN FOR ABOUT $25.00 AND IT WOULD STAY IN EFFECT RETAINING THE \"NO COST\" FACTOR ONLY IF WE BROUGHT THE RING IN EVERY SIX MONTHS. SO HOME WE WENT WITH MY NEW SPARKELING BLUE AND DIAMOND WEDDING BAND. THE MORE I LOOKED AT IT THE MOE I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS SPECIAL RING. IT KEPT ME HAPPY AND NOT THINKING ABOUT THE LOSS I HAD SUFFERED. THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER WE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THIS SALES WOMAN AT THE JEWRLY STORE WHERE WE HAD PURCHASED THE NEW RING. SHE WAS SO EXCITED TO TELL US THAT INDEED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE A VERY SIMILAR WEDDING BAND TO MINE THAT WAS FOR SALE IN ONE OF THEIR OTHER STORES AT ANOTHER MALL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF DETROIT. SHE TOLD ME THA SHE SENT A VIDEO OF THIS RING TO MY EMAIL AND IF I WATCHED THE VIDEO AND FELT THE RING WAS A FAIRLY CLOSE MATCH ..TO GIVE HER A CALL BACK.AND SHE GAVE ME HER FULL NAME; THE NAME AND LOCATION OF THE JEWLER AND PHONE NUMBER. I RAN TO MY COMPUTER OPENED UP MY EMAIL AND SUE ENOUGH THERE WAS A MESSAGE FROM THIS JEWLRY SHOP. I OPENED IT UP AND CLICKED ON THE VIDEO OF WHAT SHE FELT WAS A VERY CLOSE MATCH TO MY ORIGIONAL RING PICTURE. THE VIDEO BEGAN AND THERE ON A LITTLE BLACK VELVET PEDESTAL SAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WHITE GOLD WITH 60 DIAMOND CHIPS SURROUNDING THE BAND ON BOTH SIDES TURNING AROUND AND AROUND IN CIRCLES WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINNING DOWN UPON THE RING CAUSING IT TO SPARKLW AND TWINKLE LIKE STARLIGHT! IT WASN'T MY EXACT RING...IT WAS BETTER. THE DESGIN WAS A BIT DIFFERENT IN HEIGHT WHEN LOOKING AT IT FROM THE SIDE. THE STONES FORMED A CROWN SHAPE RATHER THAN BEING LAID FLAT AGAINST THE BAND. THIS IS WHAT I FELT WAS CAUSING THE LIGHT TO FULLY PENETRATE ALL OF THE DIAMONDS. I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I WAS CRYING AND MY HUSBAND FELT THIS WAS A REAL LIFE MIRACLE. WHEN WE CALLED UP OUR SALES GIRL AND TOLD HER THE GOOD NEWS WE ALSO ASKED THE PRICE OF THIS NEW RING. SHE GAVE IT TO US AND IT WAS ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS MORE THAN THE ORIGIONAL RING HAD BEEN. SHE EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE CONSTANT RISE IN THE PRICE OF GOLD, SILVER AND GEM STONES. WE SAID THAT WE WOULD DRIVE RIGHT OVER AND PURCHASE THE NEW RING WITH THE RESTORATION PLAN FOR ANOTHER $25.00. ON THE RIDE OR DRIVE ACROSS TOWN TO THE LAKESIDE MALL, I KEPT LOOKING DOWN AT MY REPLACEMENT RING ON MY LEFT HAND. IT HAD GROWN TO BE A PART OF MY HISTORY NOW AND HAD GROWN IN WORTH TO ME BECAUSE THIS WAS THE RING THAT I HAD WORN WHILE I GRIEVED THE LOSS OF MY ORIGIONAL WEDDING RING.AND NOW I HAD TO PART WITH THIS RING TOO. I FELT SAD INSIDE. MIKE ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG AND I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD GROWN FOND OF THE BLUE AND WHITE RING THAT SPARKLED.AND WAS HAVING A LITTLE DIFFICULTY PARTING WITH IT. I ASKED HIM IF I COULD HAVE BOTH RINGS (hanging my head in shame knowing i was just being very selfish and greedy). I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE REQUEST BACK AND APOLOGIZED TO MIKE. SO WE PICKED UP THE REPLACEMENT LOOK A LIKE WEDDING BAND THAT REALLY WAS A MUCH BETTER DESIGN THAN THE STOLEN ONE HAD.BEEN. I HANDED THE BLUE RING BACK OVER TO THE SALES GIRL MY BLUE RING AND THANKED HER FOR LETTING ME WEAR IT WHILE I WAITED THOSE FEW DAYS. SHE PLACED IT BACK INTO THE GLASS CASE AFTER CLEANING IT AND BUFFING IT UP. I FELT LIKE I WAS SAYING GOODBY TO A FRIEND THAT HAD HELPED ME THROUGH A HARD MOMENT IN MY LIFE. MIKE COULD SEE THE SADNESS IN MY EYES AND PROMISED ME THAT WHEN WE REACHED OUR 25 YEAR ANNIVERSARY THAT HE WOULD PURCHASE THIS RING FOR ME OR ONE JUST LIKE IT. THAT MADE ME FEEL BETTER. BUT EACH TIME WE PASSED THIS WELL KNOWN JEWLRY STORE AT ANY MALL ANYWHERE, I WOULD HAVE TO RUN IN AND SEE IF MY BLUE RING WAS IN THEIR DISPLAY CASE. MOST OF THE TIME IT WAS NOT THERE BUT A COUPLE TIMES I DID SEE ONE JUST LIKE IT. THE LOSS AND MEMORY HAUNTED ME. WHENEVER I WOULD FIND MYSELF LOOKING THROUGH A CATALOGUE THAT HAD COME IN THE MAIL , I WOULD FIND MYSELF TURNING FIRST TO THE WEDDING BAND PAGES AND LOOKING . SO, I DONT EVEN RECALL HOW I ENDED UP SEEING THIS RING ON YOUR WEB SITE. THERE IS NO REASON FOR ME TO BE LOOKING AT JEWLRY. ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT SOMEHOW POPPED UP AND CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. I CLICKED ON IT AND NOTICED HOW INEXPENSIVE THIS RING WAS. I FIGURED THE STONES WERE MOST LIKELY NOT GENUINE DIAMONDS AND BLUE SAPHIRES AND MOST LIKELY IT WASNT WHITE GOLD BUT SILVER. I WAS RIGHT. BUT IT WAS SO CHEAP!! AND IT LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL. SO I CLOSED MY EYES AND CLICKED ON THE \"PLACE IN CART\" ICON AND PAID IN FULL FOR THE RING PICTURED ABOVE. I ORDERED A SIZE 6 AND IT FITS PERFECTLY ON MY RIGHT HAND RING FINGER. MIKE OPENED THE PACKAGE AND SEEING THE RING , HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A FACE OF SHOCK AND HORROR. \"JANET ! HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS?\" I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS LIKE TEN OR TWENTY DOLLARS. HE SAID \"IT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOUR BLUE RING THAT YOU STILL SPEAK OF. HE SMILED AND PLACED IT ON MY RIGHT HAND RING FINGER. WE HUGGED EACHOTHER AND AGAIN HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD BUY ME THE REAL THING ON OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY. WELL, NOW THAT IS NOT FAR OFF ..ONLY ABOUT TWO YEARS OR LESS. I DONT THINK THAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW CLOSE IN TIME OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY WAS. SO I TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD PROMISED ME THAT IT WOULD BE ON OUR 25TH ANNIVERSARY THAT HE WOULD BUY ME THE BLUE RING. HE SAID \"WELL, WE SHALL SEE HOW OUR FUNDS GO OK?\" WE HUGGED AGAIN AND I KNEW THAT I HAD MARRIED THE RIGHT MAN AND I WAS WEARING THE RIGHT RING ON MY LEFT RING FINGER. I FELT HAPPY IN MY HEART.AND VERY BLESSED. JANET DELVECCHIO :) :)"

When it arrived, I was concerned that it would be too firm, but it forms so nicely around your neck and head that it is amazingly comfortable. I've had quite a bit of shoulder pain when I sleep and unexpectedly this pillow relieved much of that. I love the support it gives. I did not notice an off odor with my pillow and after opening I just let it sit a few hours on my bed before using. It fluffed up nicely before bedtime. Great product would definitely recommend!\nUpdating! I've continued to use this pillow every night! It looks just like it did when I got it. The loft is still the same - it hasn't squished flat like many regular pillows have for me in the past. I thought you might like to see a few fun comparison pictures for the loft and \"squish\" (I'm sure there's a technical term for that but squish is what it does when I sleep on it and that's good enough for me!) The measurement of inches doesn't do much for me unless I have a ruler handy - so I chose a few of my favorite products to compare with:\n\n1 - My pillow is just over the height of a Hershey bar... which is 6 inches.\n2 - The average weight of a human head is 8-12 lbs, so I chose a gallon of milk (which weighs just over 8 pounds) to set on the pillow to show how much it sinks when you lay your head on it. I'd say not quite half.\n3 - I can press a little deeper with my hand and when I let go the pillow fills right back up to the full Hershey Bar height.\n4 - I love the protective cover on the outside of the pillow. Nice little zipper that allows you to wash that case if it becomes soiled through your pillowcase. You can see the shredded foam inside but it is shredded and packed so well that you don't feel any distinct pieces. It feels like one solid form.\n\nI have really continued to enjoy this pillow as it supports my neck and head well. It is much more firm than I've slept on in the past but so comfortable."

I honestly thought this would be a much more expensive pillow!\n\nUpon opening the pillow, we found it compressed for packaging. It advises to let the pillow rise for 24 to 48 hours, but honestly it looked useable after just a few hours. There was a slight odor, but that is common for memory foam pillows. I didn't notice the odor after the first 24 hours. I left it outside a pillow case during this time, so that may have helped.\n\nThe shredded memory foam gives this pillow a different feel than your standard memory foam pillow. It feels a bit closer to a standard pillow than standard memory foam pillows do. It is a very dense pillow (feels heavy), but it is very soft. This pillow is very easy to bunch and shape how you would like. This allowed me to get great support on either my side or back.\n\nPros:\nVery well made, strong fabric\nLots of support for any position\n\nCons:\n24 hour wait before using\nHaving to share because everyone wants one\nIt is only physically supportive. As of yet it hasn't provided any emotional support.\n\nFantastic pillow. I would definitely recommend it."

I have the back legs of the trundle bed hanging off of the area rug, on the hardwood floor, which is fine since it is the back.  I did not want a larger rug because it would then breach my \"walkway\" in between two separate area rugs.  \n\nThe other area rug in the 2nd photo is the Safavieh Classic Ultra Handmade Light Blue Shag Rug (8'6 x 11'6), Item #13399105, also purchased on overstock.com  Safavieh makes beautiful rugs; these rugs run around $700-800 retail price, and they are a steal on overstock.

This bed looks great in person and will work well for him even after college. The only issue I had was when the bed was delivered it appeared that he had only received the headboard. We called customer service and they informed us it may have been shipped in multiple boxes so we should wait 48 hours to see if any other boxes are delivered before making a claim for missing pieces. We waited 3 days and no other boxes were received so I called customer service again. The person I spoke with was kind and helpful and put in a request for the missing pieces to be shipped to us. Another 2 days went by and I received a call from Overstock customer service (I missed answering it) and then a follow up email asking if I had found the missing pieces INSIDE the headboard. They said there is either a zipper or velcro piece to open and the remaining parts of the bed would be inside. WELL I'LL BE! My son opened up the back of the bed and everything he needed was inside. It would have been helpful if they placed instructions in the box or simply a tag that notes the remaining items are inside the headboard and that customer service would have access to know that when people call looking for the other parts. Overall my son LOVES the bed just stinks he had to wait an extra week to get it put together to enjoy it."

It has hardwood floors in the living room and master bedroom, linoleum in the kitchen and baths, and short pile carpet in the other 2 bedrooms. There are also a few throw rugs. We have had other cordless stick vacs that worked just OK for a short while. Couldn't do the whole house on single charge and didn't really pick up that well and had a small dirt container capacity. So, mainly used just for quick pick-ups. I had purchased 2 of these Shark cordless vacs as gifts for my daughters for Christmas. They loved them so much that I thought, well, what the heck, I'll get one for our house and give it a go. Following the recommended initial usage instructions, giving it an initial full charge, I set to work on cleaning the house. Used low setting for the hardwood and linoleum floors, and high setting for carpeted bedrooms. It did a great job and the battery lasted almost through the last bedroom. This was the first use, though, and after 4 or 5 usages until the battery was drained and it stopped (as mentioned in the manual), it now does all the house before running out of battery. It's interesting to note that on low setting, if you go to a pile throw rug or carpet, it senses the additional friction on the brush, and the vac actually kicks up the speed of the roller brush! That really surprised me! Also, the LED lights are positioned such that they show every piece of dirt and lint in front of the head. The lights work so well that I don't turn on the house lights when vacuuming. The only thing the Shark Cordless seems to have a problem with is picking up the occasional piece of my wife's fine, black hair from the linoleum on low speed. Might be because of the static from the hair to the linoleum. But, I just kick up the vac to high speed for a moment, and up comes the hair. Also, beware when using on throw rugs not to get the edge of the rug caught up the roller brush! Bottom line is that this is one impressive cordless vac at this price point. It cleans everything as promised. The dust bin holds a lot before having to empty, and the bin is so easy to remove and empty. Just hope it lasts well beyond warranty."

        "@value": "Juicy Couture has always been synonymous with images of velour track suits and grown women carrying around teacup poodles in their purse---in other words, not me. I am a perfume connoisseur and my taste usually tends toward the unusual, the niche boutique scents created by artisan perfumers. Then around Christmas, my sister spritzed a bit of  her Juicy Couture eau de parfum on my wrist and the scent was shockingly complex, feminine, with quadruple levels of notes. This was a grown woman's scent. I sought out a few sample sizes to make sure that I would enjoy the scent over time and after trying it out every day for weeks,  I knew that I wanted to purchase the big bottle. Juicy Couture perfume gave me LIFE with each whiff and the sillage is incredible ( the scent cloud that a perfume gives off) lasting for 6-8 hours or more.  Since the fragrance is  a more mainstream scent that's been out for awhile, I still wanted to find a bargain.  \r\n\r\nThe price on Overstock seemed like a great deal without being preposterous (read: so inexpensive that it was likely a definite fake). I purchased it along with two other perfumes (lesser known fragrances--have not received them yet).  The perfume arrived separately from the other perfumes as the customer service agent said the JC came from a different warehouse. Shipping was fast and the outer mailing package was well wrapped---no complaints there.\r\n\r\nNow for the disappointment: Online there are multiple sites that will walk consumers through the differences between the real and the fake of JC because evidently this is such an issue on other retail sites. The box itself will pass all of the markers for authenticity. Whomever developed this one must have read the info on those sites and designed the perfume box accordingly. The difference lies in two fundamental aspects: the \"J\" charm and the actual scent notes. \r\n\r\nIn the interest of some sort of brevity, I will deal with the most important-- the actual scent. This is a fair dupe in scent if it were purchased knowingly as a dupe. It smells like what a designer impostor would create if they were to formulate a JC-like scent but it lacks the cheap rock bottom  price of a designer impostor as well as the nuances and dry down (how the perfume smells after being on the skin for 30 minutes or more) of the real deal. Most noticeably, the scent when originally applied gives off  an ACRID chemical alcohol scent. Not pleasant, very noticeable and nothing like the real deal when first applied. \r\n\r\nThe alcohol scent is the first and most important tip off.  After the noxious first impression, the scent dries down to a sickly sweet slightly funky and \"close\" (picture a young girl in middle school who is new to the concept of wearing perfume and as such overdoes it with a cheap drugstore perfume) smell. Simply wretched when you know what the real Juicy Couture smells like. \r\n\r\nThere is no patchouli base which tempers the gourmand notes of creme brulee. The water hyacinth resembles a chemical air freshener's impression of the flower. What I loved about the real JC is that it dried down to what I wish Narciso Rodriguez For Her would smell like on me, meaning the way that it smells in the magazine insert or at the perfume counter (unfortunately that very lovely  perfume turns to something entirely different on my skin)----very green and floral with a powdery note and an adult musk to it (not funk). Seductive and sexy without being cloying or overpowering. \r\n\r\nThis has none of the beautiful subtlety of the real Juicy Couture. The strong alcohol scent really did it for me--I just could not--it gave me a headache. The good thing is that Overstock stood by me as a customer, they were incredibly apologetic and they took care of me. I likely will continue to purchase rare lesser known perfumes through OS, but I will skip the mainstream ones that may pose risk of counterfeit."

Any of you ladies every smell Carolina Herrera's \"212\" for Men? This almost smells like a female equivalent. I know they carry the women version, but it's not as sexy as the men's one. Anyway, I LOOOOVE Daisy! It's not annoyingly sweet, or overpowering. It's appropriate for pretty much any season, it's young, and the bottle design looks much more elegant in person. It's just the perfect light, crisp, fresh and femme scent with heavenly notes of greenery, slight fruityness, and musk, all tied together by a lace of breezy meadows of fresh flowers.It's a win for the hubby and I. :)"

        "@value": "So I'm on the spectrum, so you'll need to bear with me here. I am incredibly bothered by things that are not textured right. There are some things that are described as soft because they have individual fibers of soft yarn that are piled together. When you combine them all, the individual strands make a slight friction that is rather irritating against the microscopic hills and valley of my skin. Some might consider that to be \"tickling,\" but to me it feels like tiny razor blades slicing my skin. \n\nWhen I'm at stores that have the towel and blanket sections, I am sensitive to the overhead lights. They have a tendency to give me a panic attack, so to calm down I put my hand inside the rolled up blankets, towels, and carpets and it helps to make me relax a bit. Every now and then there is a blanket with a softness that makes everything more than just okay. It becomes perfect. \n\nAfter studying these kinds of sublime materials for years, I decided to take a chance on this rug because it looked like similar rugs that had similar softness. And I was totally off the mark. This rug is BEYOND SOFT. When you first step on it, remove your socks so you get the full benefit of the strands as they meet your feet. As your toes crash against the clusters of fibers, the gentle caress is like a gentle breeze against your skin. A shifted foot pulled back glides evenly over the fabric like plush cotton balls drifting across a room influenced by an oscillating fan at low speeds.\n\nThe strands are bunched together and are not delicate enough to tickle you or irritate the skin like drag a feather against the sole. Since it came rolled up, everything is matted so I assume that some shedding will occur. It does warn about that on the bottom label along with a suggestion for vacuuming often.\n\nI only gave it four stars because it's not as plush as I would have wanted it to be. It's not as thin as the sheepskin rug at Ikea, but it's not as cushy as other rugs. I wish it had a little reflexion so it was more comfortable to stand on for longer periods. In order to do that I'd need to get some sort of other rug that was exactly the same dimension as this one and affix it somehow. \n\nIf you are looking for a texture that is uniformly soft, like that of an Akita puppy or Gund stuffed animal, then this is the most awesome texture that I've come across. It's not particularly spongy enough to stand on by itself (I have oak hardwood floors), but the softness of the fabric greatly overcomes that flaw. "

If you are looking at the picture online it looks most like what you see in the furnished room. It is in NO way  as thick as the other pictures but it looks nice. I rolled the ends backwards for a few minutes to get it to lay flat and its is perfect. If you are purchasing for a higher traffic area  maybe get a felt pad to put under it as it is a little slippery on hard wood floor.  The 2nd rug I had purchased originally was $899 so this was a nice price and gets the job done. I know how hard it is to purchase on line items as I am furnishing a whole house right now based on reviews of others because there is so much to choose from. Hope this helps someone else feel good about ordering this rug, I got the 8 x 10 size and would say don't hesitate to buy this. Great price and decent quality.  Just remember it is not thick and plushy it is more like a floppy pile that falls different ways and is thinner but you don't see the backing at all. Happy shopping."

After contacting overstock, a new table top was sent out and arrived within two days.  \r\n\r\nAssembly of the table is straightforward; you need only attach the legs to the table top.  However, the chairs are more involved, although not particularly complicated: you need to assemble the backs, then the seat base, next the legs, and finally the seat pad itself.  Although it is claimed you do not need any tools (a ratchet and plastic screwdriver are included), I used a metal screwdriver to attach the seat pad to the seat base, as you have to screw directly into the seat pad itself and the supplied screwdriver was not strong enough to do so securely enough for my liking.  \r\n\r\nThe construction is good; the wood is solid and most of the screws go into metal threads, and not the wood itself.  It is very sturdy, and the seats hold a 6', 190lb individual without a problem.  I have been using the table now for three months without a problem.  \r\n\r\nThe design is basic and clean, and just what I was looking for.  I highly recommend."

The laminate was slightly cracked and missing, but not worth returning and waiting for a replacement. I camouflaged the damage with black marker and fortunately, the spots are not noticeable unless you know what you're looking for. If this were a more expensive set, I would have sent it back. \r\n\r\nThe assembly takes a while, especially with the chairs, because they have a lot of parts and hardware. It's not difficult, though, and all the pieces and hardware were included. I just needed a hammer and Philips screwdriver. It took me just under 2 hours (with breaks) to put the entire set together. I didn't mind the chairs having so many pieces because it means the end result is very sturdy. \r\n\r\nThe upholstery material on the seats is extremely cheap and collects lint like nobody's business, but I plan to reupholster them with my own fabric - just pull and staple it to the bottom. Easy fix. \r\n\r\nI'd suggest this set for anyone who needs a quick solution."

You do have to assemble them and the cord seemed to be twisting inside as i screwed them together. IT unwound itself until i realized I hadn't screwed tightly enough. Once i resolved this aspect, they have held together nicely. Shades sit even and all looks good. Have been using them for over a month now and they are super."

I'm an interior designer and I know how hard it is to buy online, especially a purchase as large as this. So here are a few Q&As that might help you feel confident with your purchase.\r\nQ: Does it look cheap? A: Not at all.  It definitely has a nice high-end look. In fact, it looks as if it came from C&B or PB.\r\nQ: Is this a good quality rug?  A: YES! It is very well made. The backing is completely hidden, due to the ample amount of strands.\r\nQ: What is the texture like?  A: It's a mix of both thin & medium 1.5 inch stands. Soft and very plush. \r\nQ: Is the color a true ivory?  A: It was a tad bit darker than I expected. To me it's more of a light cream than an ivory, but it works.   \r\nQ: What is the backing like?  A: It's a quality non-skid backing.\r\nQ: What are the sides like?  A: Each side is wrapped in a matching tightly woven thread and hidden under the overlap of rug strands.\r\nQ: Does it hold it's shape?  A: Yes. I fluffed it straight out of the package and have walked/sat/laid on it and it still looks pretty good.\r\nQ: Does it clean easily?  A: Too new to tell, but if you maintain it properly each week, it should last you a very long time.\r\n\r\nI hope these Q&As have helped. I purchased this rug for myself, but will definitely keep it in mind for a future design job. Best of luck and Happy Shopping!"

After buying some new leather sofas a few years ago I started to become disenchanted with the lamp and wanted to replace it. Lamp styles are a challenge in log home decor but when I saw this one I was struck by how well it would complement the other two Tiffany style lamps in our house. I also needed a lamp that would work for reading as well as ambience. The price was so reasonable I couldn't pass it up and I couldn't be happier. The colors are exactly as shown on the website, the dragonfly wings produce a delightful sparkle, the two bulbs offer sufficient light for reading, and the lamp itself is quite heavy so I'm not concerned about it tipping over. All in all it was a great purchase!"

For the money paid, this product is well worth it.  You can't expect to pay cheap for solid wood products. You get what you pay for. That being said, I am happy with the quality of this product, for the price paid.\r\rBed wasn't hard to build, it took me about 3 hours, by myself. I did have a problem in that the right sides of the drawers were missing. I received 12 left sides, and 0 right sides.  Per the flyer included, I contacted the manufacturer and they pleasantly sent me the missing pieces via UPS, arriving 3 days later.   \r\rLike others have said, the drawer materials and bottoms are pretty thin and mediocre, compared to other Flat Pack manufacturers.  I wouldn't put very heavy items in these drawers without reinforcing the bottoms.  There is no brace on the bottom of these drawers.  My biggest complaint about the bed is that the drawers aren't very deep (as in height).  Considering the ample amount of unused space both above and below the drawers in the frame, the manufacturer could easily have designed larger drawers.  \r\rFortunately, I discovered that the drawers are high enough off the ground that I am actually able to store items underneath the drawers (removing the drawers). I am able to store 12 plastic storage boxes (slightly smaller than shoe boxes) underneath EACH drawer.The amount of storage I now have is quite impressive, really.\r\rI've had the bed now for about 3 weeks and all is holding up well.  I do recommend buyers get a black furniture pen (I use a black sharpie) for touch-ups.  You'll need it.  The veneer is quite thin on this bed and scratches easily. Fortunately, the black is pure black and easily matches Sharpie ink.\r\rall-in-all, I'm happy with my purchase. The price is great and the amount of storage i have is better than I could have imagined."

In light of that, I feel the price is too high for what you get, particularly with the extensive assembly time. This bed is not for someone who is not experienced in assembling things. My husband, who is quite proficient, spent about 6 hours overall on the assembly. He said the directions are very clear, all parts were included, but it just took time. If he had not been able to do this, I would have had to hire someone!"

The quality is nice nothing fancy. Well worth the price. If you are looking for something to leave to your family in 10 years....I don't think this is the bed for you. The drawers are on the small size so a full size pillow would not fit but a set or two of sheets could. Extra storage is always nice. With this bed YOU DO NOT NEED THE BOX SPRING!

Two people are needed to lift and assemble, but the directions are fairly straightforward and we got through with a solidly built set. The only issue we had was causing a slight cracking in the veneer on a chair beam from overtightening so beware! Took a while but that\u2019s just a function of having so many pieces. Be patient. Look: like I said, this thing is sturdy once put together. It\u2019s a dark walnut and the chairs are upholstered in a nice grey-blue thread which works perfectly ya but might be notable if you\u2019re looking for a pure or different grey. There was one scratch on a chair leg but no other blemishes upon unpacking.

I tried it on my hand and it looks very delicate and dainty. I was disappointed in the color. I hoped it would be a mauve/peach. It is very light pale peach color. At the sale price, I am happy. The band is very narrow but it looks great on thin fingers. It rests flat on your hand which is nice under gloves. It sparkles nicely and the setting looks old fashioned and vintage. My final say: If I saw it in a display case instead of online, I probably would not have purchased it and would have looked at other morganite rings. Still, its a pretty little ring is elegant, understated and a keeperbfor me."

My only complaint is that if you do not have a low profile box spring you will need a ladder to climb into bed.

It took him about 2 hours to put the chairs together, but it  was problem free.  I am using it daily  and loving this table.  The chairs are sturdier than I expected after reading reviews, perhaps that is how well they are put together.  I have a three year old who \"sits\" at it daily with me and I am not  the least bit concerned, even as she bounces and squirms around on the chair.

So, you have to sit with your back to the back of the chair for it to stay in place.  The legs also curve slightly inward, whereas most dining chair legs I've seen curve slightly outward, so this probably contributes to the un-sturdy factor of the chairs.  Also, in order to move the chairs, you cannot \"scoot\" them in or out, but you have to pick them up a little of the ground to move them.  Again, this is because they are not very sturdy.\r\r\r\rOverall, I will use the table and chairs and none of the above factors make me want to return it and find a new set.

The real question is how long they stay that way (particularly for non-down pillows, which tend to harden quite fast).\n\nI bought this set of two pillows in August of 2013. I got four months of use out of the first one, then it started getting uncomfortable. It wasn't necessarily hardened to the touch, but I'd wake up with my ear aching (I'm a side sleeper). I started using the second pillow. And that, too, was comfortable for only four months. I could probably get six months out of each pillow if I was willing to wake up with ears aching like a boxer. Note: I fluff my pillows nightly. \n\nI've never had a down alternative pillow feel comfortable for longer than four months, and I always buy well-reviewed ones. Again, the problem is that nobody reviews a year later.\n\nI'm just going to switch to down and buy a high-quality hypo-allergenic barrier to stave off allergies. As it thins (as down always does), I may place it atop one of these pillows just for the extra height/support for side-sleeping."

Looked up some reviews which were all positive.  I am very pleased with this vacuum because it is sleek and easy to use whether the upright or the canister feature.  The bagless complete seal dust cup is easy to empty.  I also like the floor nozzle that works on all surfaces without needing adjustment since I have hardwood floors, area carpet, and carpet runners. With 2 dogs and 3 cats there is a lot of fur to be vacuumed up and the power brush does a great job cleaning their beds."

My old vacuum had the same problem,but I dealt with it because it cleaned so well. I have two large indoor/outdoor dogs that shed, so I am very particular about the cleaning power and results I get. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the Shark Rotator was not as tipsy as I feared. In fact, it hasn't tipped on me yet. And it cleans fabulously and at a much better price point than the Dyson. That is the very reason I looked into this purchase was because of claims that it was just as good or better than the more expensive Dyson. I have already recommended this to my friends!"
